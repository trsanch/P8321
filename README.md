722 W. 168 Street, Room 1107B; Office hours by appointment

### TEACHING ASSISTANT
**Ashley Tseng** at3346@cumc.columbia.edu 
Friday 12-1pm, 722 W. 168 Street, Room 1107A

### COURSE DESCRIPTION
The goal of this course is to give students a stronger theoretical foundation on data science and a provide them with a technical toolkit. This course will prepare students with skills they will need to undertake research that relies on strong quantitative and data science foundations and will help prepare students to excel in other Data Science-focused course offerings in the department of Biostatistics and Environmental Health Science (EHS).  This course will build on the first half of P6360 Analysis of Environmental Health Data, which introduces coding in R and the basic framework for conducting EHS-related data analysis across EHS disciplines (e.g., toxicology, epidemiology, climate and health). This course will cover both conceptual and practical topics in data science as they relate to environmental health sciences. Each session will be divided into two parts. In the first hour of the class there will be a lecture. Following a brief 5-minute break, the last two hours of the class will be spent on a lab project where students will apply the methods they learned in the lecture.
 
### PREREQUISITES 
* Completion of MPH core (semester 1) or equivalent, corequisite with P6360 Analysis of Environmental Health Data or permission of instructor

### COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:

* Identify and download relevant sources of data
*	Recognize computationally efficient coding and algorithms  
*	Explain key steps and “best practices” in analyzing various forms of big data
*	Communicate environmental health data verbally and visually

### ASSESSMENT AND GRADING POLICY 
Student grades will be based on:

* Assignments (Weekly; 6 total)	60%
* Lab Participation (Weekly; 7 total)	35%
* Self-Evaluation	5%

### Assignments
Homework assignments will be assigned at the end of the lab component in the second half of the class. It will comprise a written exercise based on a list of suggestions from the lecturer or a relevant computational analysis. Homework exercises should demonstrate comprehension of the material and reflect a considerable computational undertaking evidenced by complex data analysis, normalization, transformation, extrapolation, and/or distillation from a very large data set. The assignments should reflect a sophisticated question with considerable innovation, calculation, and/or visualization. The course director, lecturers, and TA are available to help students with question and analyses.

* **How to submit assignments:**
  + All course exercises are to be turned in electronically via GitHub **and** courseworks. 
  + Please remember to include your name in the filename on each submission.

### Lab Participation
This course requires a high level of engagement and participation for students to be successful. The second half of the class is reserved for practical computer lab time wherein the instructors and TA will be available to assist students in performing that week’s lab assignment to be completed in class. Students should attend all sessions and work throughout the lab session. Students are expected to be respectful of one another’s opinions and contribute to group exercises. 

### Self-Evaluation
It will be very difficult to make the most of your experience in this course without being an active member of the class community. Students should complete all assigned readings, and actively participate in discussions and ask questions. At the end of the semester students will be asked to evaluate themselves based in the following areas: preparation for class (completion of required reading), contributions to discussion (asking questions), and general conduct (respect for others). 

### Grading
**A+**  Reserved for highly exceptional achievement.

**A**   Excellent. Outstanding achievement. 

**A-**  Excellent work, close to outstanding.  

**B+**  Very good. Solid achievement expected of most graduate students.  

**B**   Good. Acceptable achievement.  

**B-**  Acceptable achievement, but below what is generally expected of graduate students.  

**C+**  Fair achievement, above minimally acceptable level.  

**C**   Fair achievement, but only minimally acceptable. 

**C-**  Very low performance.  

**F**   Failure. Course usually may not be repeated unless it is a required course. 

### Attendance Policy
Poor attendance (more than one episode of an unexcused absence) or excessive tardiness (i.e. more than two episodes of unexcused tardiness) will results in the loss of lab participation points. Students are solely responsible for any work missed as a result of tardiness or absence.

### Late Assignment Policy
Late submission of homework assignments will not be accepted.
Students may work together for all assignments but labs and homework must be prepared and submitted independently (i.e., must be your own work).

### Course Structure
Each session will be a combination of a lecture and an application lab. The first 1 to 1.5 hours will introduce the topic/tool/method and how it is applied in environmental health research, followed by a short break, and then the lab session to apply the data science skill.

#### **Session 2 (March 30, 2020) --- Finding Data Sources I (Publicly Available Data Sources)**

**Learning Objectives:**
Many environmental health analyses need to be complemented by publicly available data (e.g. that help characterize neighborhood characteristics or the built environment). Occasionally, it is possible to also obtain health data (e.g. asthma rates) from publicly available data sources. 


**Students will be able to:**

* Identify publicly available data sources 
* Download the data
* Integrate data from different data sources 


**Required Readings:**

1.	[Choirat C, Braun D, Kioumourtzoglou M-A. Data Science in Environmental Health Research. Current Epidemiology Reports. 2019 Sep 15;6(3):291-9.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40471-019-00205-5)

**Assignment:** Students will create their own environmental health dataset by finding, downloading, and integrating at least two publicly available datasets and will complete a basic descriptive data analysis project working with their new dataset. 


***

#### **Session 3 (April 6, 2020) --- Finding Data Sources II (Web Scraping and Text Mining)**

**Learning Objectives:**
While there are many environmental health-related datasets available online, many are not in a format that can be readily imported into R. There are many EHS-relevant data that are unstructured or text-heavy or simply not in tabular or rectangular data format.  Students will learn how to transform text data into data frames, which can then be analyzed using more standard methods for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.  


**Students will be able to:** 

* Convert text-heavy or non-tabular data into a data frame (“web scraping”)
*	Conduct simple text mining
*	Visualize data that originated in text format 


**Required Readings:**

1.	[Bradley, A and James, RJE.  Web Scraping Using R.  Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science.  2019, 2(3), pg 264-270.](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245919859535)

**Assignment:** 
Students will access data from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Food Establishment Inspections data (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/services/restaurant-grades.page).  Students will “scrape” these data, import them into R and use tidyverse tools to answer a set of guided questions.    

***

#### **Session 4 (April 13, 2020) --- Spatial Data Visualization and Communication**

**Learning Objectives:**
Maps have grown as popular and powerful means to communicate the spatial complexity of health and disease data. To use these tools involves GIS concepts like coordinate systems, layering, joining, and appropriately visualizing spatial data. Spatial public health data has special privacy and confidentiality considerations and unique forms of bias like the small numbers problem, edge effects, and the modifiable area unit problem. Students will gain experience working with and reporting on spatial health data, and better understand the role locational information plays in patterns of health and disease and the factors that give rise to them.


**Students will be able to:**

*	Define GIS and spatial data
*	Load and visualize spatial data in R
*	Critique and suggest improvements for published maps


**Required Readings:**

1.	[MacQuillan, E. L., Curtis, A. B., Baker, K. M., Paul, R., & Back, Y. O. (2017). *Using GIS Mapping to Target Public Health Interventions: Examining Birth Outcomes Across GIS Techniques.* Journal of Community Health, 42(4), 633–638.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-016-0298-z)

2.	Introductory chapter on GIS for Public Health

**Assignment:** 
Students will complete a descriptive data analysis project in RStudio and interpret and describe potential biases in several published maps.


***

#### **Session 5 (April 20, 2020) --- Prediction Models**

**Learning Objectives:**
There are times that, contrary to traditional epidemiological analyses where inference is the goal, the aim of a study is to build a prediction model, e.g. to predict air pollution exposures. This class will focus on how to build and validate a prediction model. Machine learning methods will also be discussed.


**Students will be able to:**

*	Explain the use of prediction models
*	Describe how to interpret health effect estimates when prediction models are used to estimate exposures


**Required Reading:**

1.

**Assignment:** Interpret health effect estimates among studies using prediction models to estimate exposures.


***

#### **Session 6 (April 27, 2020) --- Big (Molecular) Data**

**Learning Objectives:**
Increasingly cost-effective, detailed and very large datasets from “omics” fields, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have revolutionized experimental and observational environmental health research. Integrating and distilling important information across exposure data, molecular analytic platforms, and health outcomes both measured and predicted, is necessary to advance knowledge and protect human health.


**Students will be able to:**

* Describe omics technologies and their application to Environmental Health
* Identify and download publicly available molecular biomarker and high-throughput toxicology data sets
* Demonstrate familiarity with open access and subscription-based data integration tools and visualization techniques in analytical and molecular data


**Required Readings:**

**Assignment:** Integrate disease and exposure-based molecular signatures.


***

#### **Session 7 (May 4, 2020) --- Emerging Topics in Data Science**

**Learning Objectives:**
Now that students are familiar with many of the data science tools used in Environmental Health research, we will hear how an EHS alumnus uses data science outside of academic research. We will hold a round-table discussion with the guest speaker to discuss any questions students may have about applying data science skills in summer practica, future research, or towards finding a job after graduation.


**Students will be able to:**

*	Describe how data science tools taught in this class can be applied in future settings


**Required Reading:**

1. In lieu of readings this week, students should come prepared to ask our guest speaker questions.


**Assignment:** None
